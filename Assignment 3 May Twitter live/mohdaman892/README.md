Note: As the data is not in a persistent storage so the get images endpoint would return empty if hit after sometime



Create API endpoints for image processing. Implement the following endpoints:

- `Upload Image`: Accept an image file from the user and store it.
- `Convert Image`: Resize the uploaded image to 512x512 dimensions and store the converted version.
- `Get Uploaded Images`: Retrieve a list of all images uploaded by the user.
- `Download Converted Image`: Provide the converted 512x512 image for download.
